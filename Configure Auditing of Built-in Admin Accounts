When you have secured each domain's Administrator account and disabled it, you should configure auditing to monitor for changes to the account. 
If the account is enabled, its password is reset, or any other modifications are made to the account, alerts should be sent to the users or teams 
responsible for administration of AD DS, in addition to incident response teams in your organization.
