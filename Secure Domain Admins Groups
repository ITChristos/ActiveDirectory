As is the case with the Enterprise Admins group, membership in Domain Admins groups should be required only in build or disaster-recovery scenarios. 
There should be no day-to-day user accounts in the DA group with the exception of the local Administrator account for the domain.

When DA access is required, the accounts needing this level of access should be temporarily placed in the DA group for the domain in question.

In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the DA group should be added to the following user rights:

Deny access to this computer from the network
Deny log on as a batch job
Deny log on as a service
Deny log on locally
Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services
