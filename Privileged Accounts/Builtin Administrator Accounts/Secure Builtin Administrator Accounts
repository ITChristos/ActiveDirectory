Use of a domain's Administrator account should be reserved only for initial build activities, and possibly, disaster-recovery 
scenarios. To ensure that an Administrator account can be used to effect repairs in the event that no other accounts can be 
used, you should not change the default membership of the Administrator account in any domain in the forest. Instead, you 
should secure the Administrator account in each domain in the forest.


Server Manager -> Tools -> ADUC
Right-click Administrator account -> Properties
Click Account tab
    Select "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" flag

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GPO should never be linked at the domain-level because it can make the built-in Administrator account unusable, 
                        even in disaster recovery scenarios. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Group Policy Management
Group Policy Objects -> New
    Name: Restrict Administrator Accounts at the Domain-Level
Edit -> Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies, and click User Rights Assignment

    Double-click Deny access to this computer from the network -> Define these policy settings
    Add User or Group -> Browse
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Username format

Configure the user rights to prevent the Administrator account from logging on as a batch job by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on as a batch job -> Define these policy settings
    Click Add User or Group -> Browse
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK. 
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Username format

Configure the user rights to prevent the Administrator account from logging on as a service by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on as a service -> Define these policy settings
    Click Add User or Group -> Browse
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK. 
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Username format

Configure the user rights to prevent the BA account from accessing member servers and workstations via Remote Desktop Services by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services -> Define these policy settings
    Click Add User or Group -> Browse
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK. 
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Username format

To exit Group Policy Management Editor, click File -> Exit

In Group Policy Management, link the GPO to the member server and workstation OUs by doing the following
    Navigate to the \Domains\ (where is the name of the forest and is the name of the domain where you want to set the Group Policy)
    Right-click the OU that the GPO will be applied to and click Link an existing GPO
    Select "Restrict Administrator Accounts at the Domain-Level" -> OK
    
    Create links to all other OUs that contain workstations
    Create links to all other OUs that contain member servers


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!When you add the Administrator account to these settings, you specify whether you are configuring a 
local Administrator account or a domain Administrator account by how you label the accounts. For example, to add the TAILSPINTOYS domain's 
Administrator account to these deny rights, you would browse to the Administrator account for the TAILSPINTOYS domain, which would appear as 
TAILSPINTOYS\Administrator. If you type "Administrator" in these user rights settings in the Group Policy Object Editor, you will restrict 
the local Administrator account on each computer to which the GPO is applied, as described earlier. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
