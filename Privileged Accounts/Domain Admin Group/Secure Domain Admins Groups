As is the case with the Domain Admins group, membership in Domain Admins groups should be required only in build or disaster-recovery scenarios. 
There should be no day-to-day user accounts in the DA group with the exception of the local Administrator account for the domain.
Domain Admins are, by default, members of the local Administrators groups on all member servers and workstations in their respective domains. 
This default nesting should not be modified for supportability and disaster recovery purposes. If Domain Admins have been removed from the local 
Administrators groups on the member servers, the group should be added to the Administrators group on each member server and workstation in the domain


When DA access is required, the accounts needing this level of access should be temporarily placed in the DA group for the domain in question.


Remove all members from the group, with the possible exception of the built-in Administrator account for the domain
    To remove all members from the DA group
        Double-click the Domain Admins group and then click the Members tab.
        Select a member of the group, click Remove, click Yes, and click OK


In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the DA group should be added to the following user rights:
    Deny access to this computer from the network
    Deny log on as a batch job
    Deny log on as a service
    Deny log on locally
    Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services

Group Policy Management
    In the console tree, expand <Forest>\Domains\<Domain>, and then Group Policy Objects (where <Forest> is the name of the forest and <Domain> is the name of the 
    domain where you want to set the Group Policy).

    Right-click Group Policy Objects -> New
        Name: Secure Domain Admins
    Edit -> Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the Domain Admins group from accessing members servers and workstations over the network by doing the following
    Double-click Deny access to this computer from the network -> Define these policy settings
    Add User or Group -> Browse
    Type Domain Admins -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Domain Admins format

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the Domain Admins group from logging on as a batch job by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on as a batch job -> Define these policy settings
    Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Domain Admins -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Domain Admins format

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the EA group from logging on as a service by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on as a service -> Define these policy settings
    Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Domain Admins -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Domain Admins format

Configure user rights to prevent members of the Domain Admins group from logging on locally to member servers and workstations by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on locally -> Define these policy settings
    Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Domain Admins -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Domain Admins format

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the Domain Admins group from accessing member servers and workstations via Remote Desktop Services by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services -> Define these policy settings
    Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Domain Admins -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Domain Admins format

To exit Group Policy Management Editor, click File -> Exit

In Group Policy Management, link the GPO to the member server and workstation OUs by doing the following
    Navigate to the \Domains\ (where is the name of the forest and is the name of the domain where you want to set the Group Policy)
    Right-click the OU that the GPO will be applied to and click Link an existing GPO
    Select "Secure Domain Admins" -> OK

    Create links to all other OUs that contain workstations
    Create links to all other OUs that contain member servers
    In a forest that contains multiple domains, a similar GPO should be created in each domain that requires that the Domain Admins group be secured

!!!!!!!If jump servers are used to administer domain controllers and Active Directory, ensure that jump servers are located in an OU to which this GPOs is not linked!!!!!!!!!
