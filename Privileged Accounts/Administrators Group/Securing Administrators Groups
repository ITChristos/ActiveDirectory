As is the case with the Enterprise Admins (EA) and Domain Admins (DA) groups, membership in the built-in Administrators (BA) 
group should be required only in build or disaster recovery scenarios. There should be no day-to-day user accounts in the 
Administrators group with the exception of the Built-in Administrator account for the domain, if it has been secured as 
described in Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory.

Administrators are, by default, the owners of most of the AD DS objects in their respective domains. Membership in this group 
may be required in build or disaster recovery scenarios in which ownership or the ability to take ownership of objects is required.

DAs and EAs inherit a number of their rights and permissions by virtue of their default membership in the Administrators group. 
Default group nesting for privileged groups in Active Directory should not be modified, and each domain's Administrators group 
should be secured as described


For the Administrators group in each domain in the forest
    Remove all members from the Administrators group, with the possible exception of the built-in Administrator account for the domain,
    provided it has been secured as described in Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory.

In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the BA group should be added to the following user rights 
in Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\ User Rights Assignment:
    Deny access to this computer from the network
    Deny log on as a batch job
    Deny log on as a service

At the domain controllers OU in each domain in the forest, the Administrators group should be granted the following user rights:

    Access this computer from the network
    Allow log on locally
    Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services

In Server Manager, click Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers

To remove all members from the Administrators group
    Double-click the Administrators group -> Members tab
    Select a member of the group -> Remove -> Yes -> OK.
