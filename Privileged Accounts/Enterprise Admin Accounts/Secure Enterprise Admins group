As described earlier, the Enterprise Admins group should contain no users on a day-to-day basis, with the possible exception of the forest 
root domain's Administrator account, which should be secured as described in Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory.
Enterprise Admins are, by default, members of the Administrators group in each domain in the forest. You should not remove the EA group from the 
Administrators groups in each domain because in the event of a forest disaster recovery scenario, EA rights will likely be required.

In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the EA group should be added to the following user rights in 
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignments:
    Deny access to this computer from the network
    Deny log on as a batch job
    Deny log on as a service
    Deny log on locally
    Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services.

Server Manager -> Tools -> ADUC
    If you are not managing the root domain for the forest, in the console tree, right-click , and then click Change Domain (where is the name of 
    the domain you're currently administering)
        In the Change domain dialog box, click Browse, -> root domain for the forest -> OK

To remove all members from the EA group
    Double-click the Enterprise Admins group and then click the Members tab.
    Select a member of the group, click Remove, click Yes, and click OK

Group Policy Management
    In the console tree, expand \Domains\, and then Group Policy Objects (where is the name of the forest and is the name of the domain where you want 
    to set the Group Policy).
!!!!!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, a similar GPO should be created in each domain that requires that the Enterprise Admins group be secured.
    Right-click Group Policy Objects -> New
        Name: Secure Enterprise Admins
    Edit -> Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies, and click User Rights Assignment

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the Enterprise Admins group from accessing member servers and workstations over the network by doing the following
    Double-click Deny access to this computer from the network -> Define these policy settings
    Add User or Group -> Browse
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Enterprise Admins format

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the Enterprise Admins group from logging on as a batch job by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on as a batch job -> Define these policy settings
    Click Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Enterprise Admins format

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the EA group from logging on as a service by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on as a service -> Define these policy settings
    Click Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Enterprise Admins format

Configure user rights to prevent members of the Enterprise Admins group from logging on locally to member servers and workstations by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on locally -> Define these policy settings
    Click Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Enterprise Admins format

Configure the user rights to prevent members of the Enterprise Admins group from accessing member servers and workstations via Remote Desktop Services by doing the following
    Double-click Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services -> Define these policy settings
    Click Add User or Group -> Browse
        !!!!!!In a forest that contains multiple domains, click Locations and select the root domain of the forest!!!!!!
    Type Administrator -> Check Names -> OK. 
        Verify that the account is displayed in \Enterprise Admins format

To exit Group Policy Management Editor, click File -> Exit

In Group Policy Management, link the GPO to the member server and workstation OUs by doing the following
    Navigate to the \Domains\ (where is the name of the forest and is the name of the domain where you want to set the Group Policy)
    Right-click the OU that the GPO will be applied to and click Link an existing GPO
    Select "Secure Enterprise Admins" -> OK

    Create links to all other OUs that contain workstations
    Create links to all other OUs that contain member servers
    In a forest that contains multiple domains, a similar GPO should be created in each domain that requires that the Enterprise Admins group be secured

!!!!!!!If jump servers are used to administer domain controllers and Active Directory, ensure that jump servers are located in an OU to which this GPOs is not linked!!!!!!!!!
