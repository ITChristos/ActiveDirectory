Privileged and VIP accounts in AD DS. Monitor for changes, particularly changes to attributes on the Account tab (for example, cn, name, sAMAccountName, userPrincipalName, or userAccountControl). In addition to monitoring the accounts, restrict who can modify the accounts to as small a set of administrative users as possible.
Changes to the properties and membership of following AD DS groups: Enterprise Admins (EA), Domain Admins (DA), Administrators (BA), and Schema Admins (SA)
Disabled privileged accounts (such as built-in Administrator accounts in Active Directory and on member systems) for enabling the accounts
