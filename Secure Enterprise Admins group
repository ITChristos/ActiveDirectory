As described earlier, the Enterprise Admins group should contain no users on a day-to-day basis, with the possible exception of the forest 
root domain's Administrator account, which should be secured as described in Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory.

In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the EA group should be added to the following user rights:
Deny access to this computer from the network
Deny log on as a batch job
Deny log on as a service
Deny log on locally
Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services.
